### 3. Behavior Description Patterns

| Feature | wshobson | VoltAgent | Our Framework |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Trigger Keywords** | Always ("PROACTIVELY", "MUST BE USED") | Never (relies on semantic matching) | Sometimes |
| **Length** | 200-300 chars | 250-350 chars | 150-250 chars |
| **Structure** | Role + Expertise + Trigger | Role + Expertise + Focus | Role + Domain |
| **Specificity** | Very specific, actionable | Comprehensive, detailed | Framework-specific |

**Examples**:

```yaml
# wshobson - backend-architect
description: "Design RESTful APIs, microservice boundaries, and database schemas. Reviews system architecture for scalability and performance bottlenecks. Use PROACTIVELY when creating new backend services or APIs."

# VoltAgent - backend-developer
description: "Senior backend engineer specializing in scalable API development and microservices architecture. Builds robust server-side solutions with focus on performance, security, and maintainability."

# Our framework - service-extractor
description: "Extract services from use case specifications following service-oriented architecture principles"
```

| **Custom Tools** | Few | Many (database, redis, magic, context7) | None (standard tools only) |
| **Documentation** | Tools field often omitted | Always specified | Always specified |

**Examples**:

```yaml
# wshobson - code-reviewer (inferred/minimal)
# Tools not specified in YAML (defaults used)

# VoltAgent - fullstack-developer (comprehensive)
tools: Read, Write, MultiEdit, Bash, Docker, database, redis, postgresql, magic, context7, playwright

# Our framework - service-extractor (explicit/restricted)
tools: [Read, Write, Glob, Grep]
```

### 10. Learning from Each

#### What We Can Learn from wshobson/agents

1. **Explicit Trigger Keywords**: "Use PROACTIVELY" significantly increases automatic invocation
2. **Model Selection**: Strategic use of opus vs sonnet based on task complexity
3. **Concise Prompts**: 200-400 words is often sufficient
4. **Practical Focus**: Direct, actionable guidance over theory
5. **Production-Ready**: Agents are well-tested and battle-hardened

**Application to our framework**:
```yaml
# Before
description: "Extract services from use case specifications"

# After (with wshobson pattern)
description: "Extract services from use case specifications following service-oriented architecture principles. Use PROACTIVELY when analyzing use cases or designing service boundaries."
model: opus  # Complex reasoning required
```

#### What We Can Learn from VoltAgent

1. **Comprehensive Tool Lists**: Explicit about every tool agent needs
2. **Checklist Format**: Makes expertise very clear and actionable
3. **Category Organization**: Scales well to 100+ agents
4. **Workflow Emphasis**: Strong focus on process and methodology
5. **Meta-Orchestration**: Dedicated agents for coordination

**Application to our framework**:
```markdown
## Service Extraction Checklist
- **Context Analysis**: Review use case, domain model, requirements
- **Boundary Identification**: Find service cohesion boundaries
- **Interface Design**: Define service contracts
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify inter-service dependencies
- **Validation**: Verify against architectural principles
```

#### What Others Can Learn from Our Framework

1. **Traceability**: UC → Service → Code validation
2. **Templates Integration**: Agents work with structured templates
3. **Spec-Driven**: Clear specifications drive implementation
4. **Session Protocols**: Structured workflow for each session
5. **Context Management**: Explicit guidelines for context usage
6. **Git Integration**: Tight coupling with version control workflow

**Application to general agents**:
```markdown
## Traceability Protocol
Before implementing:
1. Read relevant use cases
2. Verify service specifications exist
3. Check alignment with technical decisions
4. Update traceability documentation

After implementing:
1. Update service-registry.md
2. Link code to specifications
3. Validate UC-Service-Code traceability
```
