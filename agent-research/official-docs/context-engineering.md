**Purpose**: Synthesize Anthropic's guidance on context engineering for AI agents

## Core Principle: Context is a Finite Resource

> Context is a "finite resource" with **diminishing returns** as token count increases.

### Goal of Context Engineering

Find the **"smallest possible set of high-signal tokens"** to maximize desired outcomes.

**Trade-off**: More context ≠ better results
- Too little context: Agent lacks necessary information
- Too much context: Signal drowns in noise, increased latency and cost

**Sweet spot**: Sufficient context for task, minimal noise

## Structuring Agent Context

### System Prompt Architecture

**Principle**: Use clear, direct language at the "right altitude"

#### The Two Extremes to Avoid

❌ **Too Complex/Brittle**:
```
If condition A and condition B, unless flag C is set, then do X,
but if Y happens first, check Z, and if Z > threshold T,
revert to fallback F, except when...
```
**Problem**: Overly specific logic that breaks in edge cases

❌ **Too Vague/High-Level**:
```
You are a helpful assistant. Do good work.
```
**Problem**: Insufficient guidance for specific tasks

✅ **Just Right (Right Altitude)**:
```
You are a backend API developer. Review API endpoints for:
1. Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, auth bypass)
2. Performance issues (N+1 queries, missing indexes)
3. Design flaws (REST violations, missing validation)

For each issue found, provide:
- Severity (critical/high/medium/low)
- Line number
- Explanation
- Suggested fix
```

### Prompt Organization

**Recommended structure** with distinct sections:

```markdown
<background_information>
Context about the project, domain, and environment
</background_information>

<instructions>
1. Primary task
2. Step-by-step approach
3. Success criteria
</instructions>

## Tool Guidance
How and when to use each tool

## Output Description
Expected format and structure of results
</prompt>
```

### Benefits of Structured Prompts

- **Clarity**: Agent understands role and expectations
- **Consistency**: Predictable output format
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update specific sections
- **Debuggability**: Clear where to adjust for better results

## Tool Design Principles

### Create Self-Contained, Robust Tools

**Characteristics of good tools**:

1. **Self-contained**: Tool function works independently
2. **Robust to errors**: Handles edge cases gracefully
3. **Clear intended use**: Name and description make purpose obvious
4. **Minimal overlap**: Each tool serves distinct purpose

### Example: Good Tool Design

❌ **Poor Tool Design**:
```python
def read_file(path):
    # Assumes file exists, no error handling
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

✅ **Good Tool Design**:
```python
def read_file(path: str) -> dict:
    """
    Read file contents safely.

    Args:
        path: File path (absolute or relative)

    Returns:
        {"success": bool, "content": str, "error": str}
    """
    try:
        if not os.path.exists(path):
            return {"success": False, "error": f"File not found: {path}"}

        with open(path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            content = f.read()

        return {"success": True, "content": content, "error": None}

    except Exception as e:
        return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
```

### Minimize Tool Set Complexity

**Principle**: Provide minimum necessary tools

❌ **Too many overlapping tools**:
- `read_file`, `read_text_file`, `load_file`, `get_file_contents`
- **Problem**: Agent confused about which to use

✅ **Minimal, distinct tools**:
- `read_file` - Read any file
- `write_file` - Write to file
- `list_files` - List directory contents

**Benefits**:
- Faster decision-making
- Fewer errors from choosing wrong tool
- Easier to maintain

## Context Retrieval Strategies

### 1. Just-In-Time Context Loading

**Pattern**: Load context only when needed, not upfront

```
User: "Fix the authentication bug"

Agent:
1. Reads authentication-related files only
2. Identifies issue
3. Fixes bug
4. Verifies fix

(Never loads unrelated frontend or database code)
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced initial latency
- Lower token usage
- More focused analysis

**When to use**: Most tasks where full codebase isn't needed

### 2. Dynamic Data Exploration

**Pattern**: Agent explores data incrementally based on findings

```
Agent analyzing user behavior:
1. Reads sample of 100 records
2. Identifies patterns
3. Queries specific segments for more detail
4. Formulates conclusions

(Rather than loading all 1M records upfront)
```

**Benefits**:
- Handles large datasets efficiently
- Adapts to what's actually needed
- Discovers unexpected patterns

**When to use**: Large datasets, exploratory analysis

### 3. Metadata-Driven Information Discovery

**Pattern**: Use lightweight metadata to guide detailed retrieval

```
Metadata index:
{
  "user_service.py": {"description": "User CRUD operations", "dependencies": ["database", "auth"]},
  "auth_service.py": {"description": "Authentication logic", "dependencies": ["jwt", "database"]},
  ...
}

Agent:
1. Reads metadata index (lightweight)
2. Identifies relevant files
3. Loads only those files
4. Performs task
```

**Benefits**:
- Fast navigation through large codebases
- Efficient file selection
- Scalable to very large projects

**When to use**: Large codebases, unclear starting point

### 4. Hybrid Approaches

**Pattern**: Combine multiple strategies

```
1. Load essential context upfront (architecture diagrams, README)
2. Use metadata for navigation
3. Just-in-time loading for specific files
4. Dynamic exploration for debugging
```

**Benefits**: Balances speed, efficiency, and thoroughness

**When to use**: Complex projects with varied tasks

## Long-Horizon Task Techniques

### Problem: Context Window Limits

Long-running tasks exhaust context window, leading to:
- Forgotten earlier context
- Repeated work
- Degraded quality

### Solution 1: Compaction

**Technique**: Summarize conversation history periodically

```
Every 50k tokens:
1. Summarize completed work
2. Extract key decisions and state
3. Clear old conversation
4. Inject summary as new context
```

**Implementation**:
```
Summary injected:
"Completed: User authentication system with JWT tokens.
Key decisions: PostgreSQL for user storage, Redis for sessions.
Current state: Implementing password reset flow.
Next: Email verification system."
```

**Benefits**:
- Maintains continuity
- Frees context window
- Preserves critical information

**Trade-off**: Loss of fine-grained history

### Solution 2: Structured Note-Taking

**Technique**: Maintain persistent memory outside context window

```
# task-state.md (written to disk)

## Completed
- [x] User registration API
- [x] Login endpoint
- [x] JWT token generation

## In Progress
- [ ] Password reset flow (50% done)
  - Email sending implemented
  - Token generation pending

## Decisions
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Sessions: Redis
- Email: SendGrid

## Blockers
- None
```

**Agent Workflow**:
1. Read task-state.md at start of session
2. Work on tasks
3. Update task-state.md with progress
4. Repeat next session

**Benefits**:
- Survives context window clearing
- Human-readable progress tracking
- Easy handoff between sessions

### Solution 3: Sub-Agent Architectures

**Technique**: Delegate subtasks to specialized agents with isolated contexts

```
Main Agent (Orchestrator):
- Maintains high-level task state
- Delegates to subagents

Subagent 1 (Database Design):
- Isolated context for database work
- Returns schema design

Subagent 2 (API Implementation):
- Isolated context for API work
- Returns implementation

Subagent 3 (Testing):
- Isolated context for testing
- Returns test suite

Main Agent:
- Integrates all results
- Maintains overall coherence
```

**Benefits**:
- Each subagent has fresh context
- Specialized expertise per domain
- Main agent stays focused on coordination

**When to use**: Complex, multi-domain tasks

## Practical Patterns

### Pattern 1: Minimal Base Context + On-Demand Loading

```yaml
Base Context (always loaded):
- Project README (overview)
- Architecture diagram
- Key conventions

On-Demand (load as needed):
- Specific source files
- API documentation
- Database schemas
```

**Example**:
```
User: "Add logging to user service"

Agent:
1. Reads base context (understands project structure)
2. Loads user_service.py on-demand
3. Loads logging_config.py on-demand
4. Implements logging
5. Never loads unrelated code
```

### Pattern 2: Progressive Context Refinement

```
Phase 1: High-level context
- Project overview
- Component relationships

Phase 2: Medium-level context
- Relevant module documentation
- Interface definitions

Phase 3: Detail-level context
- Specific source files
- Implementation details
```

**Example**:
```
User: "Optimize database queries"

Phase 1: Load architecture (understand DB layer)
Phase 2: Load ORM documentation (understand query patterns)
Phase 3: Load slow query files (analyze specifics)
```

### Pattern 3: Context Tiers by Usage Frequency

```
Tier 1 (HOT): Always loaded
- Project constants
- Common utilities
- Main architecture

Tier 2 (WARM): Load on likely need
- Module interfaces
- Frequently accessed files

Tier 3 (COLD): Load on explicit need
- Rarely changed files
- Historical code
- External dependencies
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Front-Loading Everything

❌ **Problem**:
```
User: "Fix a small bug in user service"

Agent loads:
- Entire codebase (500 files)
- All documentation
- Full git history
- All dependencies

Result: 180k tokens consumed, 10 minutes to process
```

✅ **Solution**: Just-in-time loading

### 2. No Context Refresh Strategy

❌ **Problem**:
```
Long session:
- Hour 1: Fresh context, good quality
- Hour 2: Context filling up, some degradation
- Hour 3: Context full, quality poor, repetitive
```

✅ **Solution**: Proactive context management (compaction, note-taking)

### 3. Tool Explosion

❌ **Problem**:
```
Agent has access to:
- 50 different tools
- Many overlapping functions
- Unclear purposes

Result: Decision paralysis, wrong tool selection
```

✅ **Solution**: Minimal, distinct tool set

### 4. Overly Complex System Prompts

❌ **Problem**:
```
System prompt:
- 2000 lines
- Nested conditionals
- Edge case handling in prompt
- Contradictory instructions

Result: Confused agent, inconsistent behavior
```

✅ **Solution**: Clear, focused prompts at "right altitude"

## Key Takeaways

### The Golden Rule

> **"Do the simplest thing that works"**

### Principles

1. **Context is finite** - Use it wisely
2. **More is not better** - Find the minimum effective context
3. **Right altitude** - Not too vague, not too complex
4. **Just-in-time** - Load context when needed, not before
5. **Structured is better** - Organize prompts and tools clearly
6. **Sub-agents for scale** - Delegate to specialized agents for complex tasks
7. **Refresh proactively** - Don't wait for context degradation
8. **Measure and iterate** - Test different strategies, keep what works

### Decision Framework

**When designing agent context, ask**:

1. **What's the minimum context needed** for this task?
2. **Can any context be loaded just-in-time** instead of upfront?
3. **Is the system prompt at the right altitude**?
4. **Are tools minimal and distinct**?
5. **How will this scale** as context grows?
6. **What's the refresh strategy** for long tasks?
