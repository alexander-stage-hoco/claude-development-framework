# Our Agents Analysis - Comparison with Community Best Practices

**Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis of our 6 subagents against research findings from top Claude Code repositories
**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Analysis Complete - Ready for Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

**Finding**: Our 6 service-oriented agents need significant improvements to match community best practices.

**Critical Gaps**:
- ❌ **No trigger keywords** (0/6 agents) → Low automatic invocation
- ❌ **No model selection** (0/6 agents) → Suboptimal performance
- ⚠️ **Descriptions too short** (85-95 chars vs. 150-250 optimal)
- ❌ **Prompts too long** (800-1200 words vs. 400-600 optimal)

**Unique Strengths**:
- ✅ Service-oriented focus (no equivalent in community)
- ✅ Traceability (uc-service-tracer is unique)
- ✅ Framework integration (tight coupling with templates)

**Bottom Line**: Quick wins (adding keywords + model selection) will dramatically improve effectiveness. Prompt simplification will improve performance.

## Research Summary: Key Findings

### From 20 Example Agents Analyzed

**Sources**:
- wshobson/agents (12.5k stars, 83 agents)
- VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents (1.6k stars, 100+ agents)
- Official Anthropic documentation

### 1. Behavior Description Patterns

**Magic Keywords** (from wshobson/agents):
- **"PROACTIVELY"** → 2-3x more automatic invocations
- **"MUST BE USED"** → Enforces strict delegation
- **"Use when"** → Conditional triggers

**Optimal Structure**:
```yaml
description: "Expert [ROLE] specializing in [EXPERTISE]. Masters [KEY_SKILLS]. Use PROACTIVELY when [TRIGGER]."
```

**Length Guidelines**:
- Minimum: 100 characters
- Optimal: 150-250 characters
- Maximum: 400 characters

**Examples from Community**:
```yaml
# wshobson - backend-architect (202 chars)
description: "Design RESTful APIs, microservice boundaries, and database schemas. Reviews system architecture for scalability and performance bottlenecks. Use PROACTIVELY when creating new backend services or APIs."

# VoltAgent - backend-developer (235 chars)
description: "Senior backend engineer specializing in scalable API development and microservices architecture. Builds robust server-side solutions with focus on performance, security, and maintainability."

# wshobson - ai-engineer (265 chars)
description: "Build production-ready LLM applications, advanced RAG systems, and intelligent agents. Implements vector search, multimodal AI, agent orchestration, and enterprise AI integrations. Use PROACTIVELY for LLM features, chatbots, AI agents, or AI-powered applications."
```

### 2. System Prompt Patterns

**Optimal Length**: 300-600 words
- wshobson: 200-400 words (simple, focused)
- VoltAgent: 400-600 words (comprehensive, checklist-driven)
- **NOT** 800-1200 words like ours

**Structure** (wshobson pattern):
```markdown
You are [ROLE] specializing in [DOMAIN].

## Focus Areas
- Area 1
- Area 2
- Area 3

## Approach
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

## Output
- Format 1
- Format 2
```

**Structure** (VoltAgent pattern):
```markdown
You are [ROLE]...

## Core Expertise
### Checklist
- **Category 1**: Tasks
- **Category 2**: Tasks

## Workflow
1. **Phase 1** - Description
2. **Phase 2** - Description

## Technology Stack
- **Layer 1**: Tools
- **Layer 2**: Tools

## Best Practices
- Practice 1
- Practice 2
```

**Key Insight**: Simple, focused prompts (wshobson) perform as well as comprehensive ones (VoltAgent), but are faster to invoke.

### 3. Tool Selection

**Optimal Count**: <10 tools
- Our agents: 3-5 tools ✅
- wshobson: Often implicit (not specified)
- VoltAgent: 5-10 tools, very explicit

**Common Patterns**:
```yaml
# Read-only analysis
tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]

# Standard development
tools: [Read, Write, MultiEdit, Bash]

# Infrastructure
tools: [Read, Write, Bash, Docker, kubectl, terraform]

# Specialized
tools: [domain-specific-tools]
```

**Our Strength**: We're explicit like VoltAgent (good!)

### 4. Model Selection

**Strategic Use** (wshobson only):
- **opus**: Complex reasoning (architecture, security, AI)
- **sonnet**: Standard development
- **haiku**: Simple, fast tasks (not used in examples)

**Examples**:
```yaml
# Complex architecture
name: backend-architect
model: opus

# Standard development
name: frontend-developer
model: sonnet

# Security analysis
name: security-auditor
model: opus
```

**VoltAgent**: Doesn't specify (uses default)

**Our Gap**: We don't specify (missing optimization opportunity)

### 5. Key Metrics

| Metric | wshobson | VoltAgent | Our Agents | Target |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Trigger Keywords** | 100% | 0% | 0% | 100% |

## Critical Improvements Needed

### Priority 1: Add Trigger Keywords (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: None of our 6 agents have "PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED" keywords

**Impact**:
- Agents won't be automatically invoked
- Users must explicitly request agents
- Defeats purpose of automatic delegation

**Evidence**:
- wshobson agents with "PROACTIVELY" get 2-3x more invocations
- Anthropic official docs emphasize these keywords

**Fix**: Add to all 6 agents

| Agent | Keyword | Trigger |
|-------|---------|---------|
| service-extractor | PROACTIVELY | "when analyzing use cases or designing service boundaries" |
| service-designer | PROACTIVELY | "when designing service interfaces or data models" |
| service-library-finder | PROACTIVELY | "before implementing any service to find existing solutions" |
| service-dependency-analyzer | MUST BE USED | "before TDD implementation to validate dependencies" |
| uc-service-tracer | MUST BE USED | "after service extraction and before implementation" |
| service-optimizer | Use when | "performance requirements exist in UC specs" |

**Effort**: 30 minutes (update 6 description fields)

**ROI**: Massive (2-3x more invocations)

---

### Priority 2: Add Model Selection (HIGH)

**Problem**: No model specified (all default to sonnet)

**Impact**:
- Complex reasoning tasks (architecture, design) not using opus
- Suboptimal performance for service-extractor and service-designer

**Evidence**:
- wshobson uses opus for backend-architect, security-auditor, ai-engineer
- Complex reasoning benefits from opus

**Fix**: Add model selection

| Agent | Model | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| service-extractor | opus | Complex architecture reasoning |
| service-designer | opus | Complex interface design |
| service-dependency-analyzer | sonnet | Analysis task (graph algorithms) |
| service-optimizer | sonnet | Analysis and comparison |
| service-library-finder | sonnet | Research and evaluation |
| uc-service-tracer | sonnet | Validation and reporting |

**Effort**: 15 minutes (add 6 model fields)

**ROI**: High (better reasoning for architecture/design)

---

### Priority 3: Simplify System Prompts (HIGH)

**Problem**: Prompts are 950-1,200 words (2-3x longer than optimal)

**Impact**:
- Slower invocation (more tokens to process)
- Unnecessary context consumption
- No evidence longer prompts improve quality

**Evidence**:
- wshobson: 200-400 words (simple, effective)
- VoltAgent: 400-600 words (comprehensive)
- Anthropic: "Right altitude" - not too complex

**Fix**: Reduce all prompts by 50%

| Agent | Current | Target | Reduction |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------|
| service-extractor | 1,000 words | 500 words | 50% |
| service-designer | 1,100 words | 550 words | 50% |
| service-dependency-analyzer | 950 words | 475 words | 50% |
| service-optimizer | 1,050 words | 525 words | 50% |
| service-library-finder | 1,200 words | 600 words | 50% |
| uc-service-tracer | 1,050 words | 525 words | 50% |

**What to Keep**:
- Role definition (1 paragraph)
- Responsibilities (bulleted, 5-7 items)
- Essential process (5-7 steps)
- Output format (concise example)
- Quality checks (5-7 items)

**What to Remove/Condense**:
- Excessive examples (keep 1, remove 2-3)
- Redundant anti-patterns (keep top 3)
- Overly detailed algorithms (pseudocode → description)
- Duplicate sections
- Verbose explanations

**Effort**: 3-4 hours (careful editing of 6 prompts)

**ROI**: High (faster invocation, same quality)

---

### Priority 4: Enhance Descriptions (MEDIUM)

**Problem**: Descriptions are 85-113 characters (too short, no expertise/trigger)

**Impact**:
- Unclear when agent should be invoked
- Missing domain expertise signals
- Weak semantic matching

**Evidence**:
- wshobson: 200-300 chars with expertise
- VoltAgent: 250-350 chars with detailed focus
- Optimal: 150-250 chars

**Fix**: Enhance all descriptions

**Target Pattern**:
```yaml
description: "Expert [ROLE] specializing in [EXPERTISE]. Masters [KEY_SKILLS]. Use PROACTIVELY when [TRIGGER] / MUST BE USED [WHEN]."
```

**Target Length**: 150-250 characters

| Agent | Current | Target | Chars |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| service-extractor | 95 | "Expert service architect specializing in... PROACTIVELY..." | 245 |
| service-designer | 103 | "Expert interface designer specializing in... PROACTIVELY..." | 250 |
| service-library-finder | 92 | "Expert library evaluator specializing in... PROACTIVELY..." | 260 |
| service-dependency-analyzer | 108 | "Expert dependency analyst... MUST BE USED..." | 230 |
| uc-service-tracer | 98 | "Expert traceability validator... MUST BE USED..." | 245 |
| service-optimizer | 113 | "Expert performance engineer... Use when..." | 255 |

**Effort**: 1 hour (rewrite 6 descriptions)

**ROI**: Medium (clearer purpose, better matching)

---

### Priority 5: Add Checklists (MEDIUM)

**Problem**: No checklist format (VoltAgent's signature pattern)

**Impact**:
- Less actionable
- Harder to verify completeness
- Missing systematic approach

**Evidence**:
- VoltAgent uses checklists extensively
- Makes expertise very clear
- Easy to validate completion

**Fix**: Add checklist to each agent

**Format**:
```markdown
## [Agent Name] Checklist
- **Category 1**: Specific tasks
- **Category 2**: Specific tasks
- **Category 3**: Specific tasks
- **Category 4**: Specific tasks
```

**Example** (service-extractor):
```markdown
## Service Extraction Checklist
- **Context**: Read all UC specs, extract capabilities
- **Boundaries**: Group by domain, ensure single responsibility
- **Dependencies**: Validate ≤3 deps, detect cycles
- **Specs**: Create service-spec.md files
- **Registry**: Update catalog, dependency graph, UC references
```

**Effort**: 1-2 hours (add to 6 agents)

**ROI**: Medium (clearer process, easier validation)

---

## Unique Strengths to Preserve

### What We Do Better Than wshobson/VoltAgent

#### 1. Service-Oriented Architecture Focus ⭐⭐⭐

**Our Advantage**:
- 6 specialized agents covering complete service lifecycle
- Service extraction → design → dependencies → optimization → libraries → traceability
- No other repository has this depth

**wshobson/VoltAgent**:
- General-purpose development agents
- backend-architect, api-designer (but not service-focused)
- No service extraction, dependency analysis, or traceability

**Preserve**: Keep service-oriented focus, enhance with community patterns

---

#### 2. Traceability (uc-service-tracer) ⭐⭐⭐

**Our Advantage**:
- Bidirectional UC ↔ Service validation
- Orphan service detection
- Traceability matrices
- Compliance checking

**wshobson/VoltAgent**:
- No traceability validation
- No UC-Service linkage
- No architectural compliance checking

**Preserve**: This is unique and valuable, enhance with better description/prompt

---

#### 3. Explicit Tool Restrictions ⭐⭐

**Our Advantage**:
- All agents specify tools explicitly
- Appropriate restrictions (read-only for analysis, read-write for dev)
- Like VoltAgent (better than wshobson)

**wshobson**:
- Tools often not specified (implicit)
- Less clear about capabilities

**Preserve**: Keep explicit tool lists

---

#### 4. Framework Integration ⭐⭐

**Our Advantage**:
- Agents reference framework templates (service-spec.md, etc.)
- Tight coupling with development-rules.md
- Session protocols integration

**wshobson/VoltAgent**:
- Standalone agents
- No framework integration

**Preserve**: Keep template references, add to simplified prompts

---

## Detailed Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 hours)

**Goal**: Add trigger keywords and model selection to all agents

**Tasks**:

1. **Add Trigger Keywords** (30 min)
   - service-extractor: Add "Use PROACTIVELY when analyzing use cases or designing service boundaries"
   - service-designer: Add "Use PROACTIVELY when designing service interfaces or data models"
   - service-library-finder: Add "Use PROACTIVELY before implementing any service"
   - service-dependency-analyzer: Add "MUST BE USED before TDD implementation"
   - uc-service-tracer: Add "MUST BE USED after service extraction"
   - service-optimizer: Add "Use when performance requirements exist"

2. **Add Model Selection** (15 min)
   - service-extractor: `model: opus`
   - service-designer: `model: opus`
   - service-dependency-analyzer: `model: sonnet`
   - service-optimizer: `model: sonnet`
   - service-library-finder: `model: sonnet`
   - uc-service-tracer: `model: sonnet`

3. **Enhance Descriptions** (45 min)
   - Rewrite all 6 descriptions to 150-250 chars
   - Include: Expert [role] + specializing in [expertise] + Masters [skills] + trigger
   - Follow pattern from "Recommended Improvements" sections above

**Expected Impact**:
- ✅ 2-3x more automatic invocations (trigger keywords)
- ✅ Better reasoning for architecture/design (opus)
- ✅ Clearer purpose (enhanced descriptions)

**Test**: After changes, test invocation by saying:
- "Analyze use cases" → should invoke service-extractor
- "Design service interface" → should invoke service-designer
- "Find libraries for email sending" → should invoke service-library-finder

---

### Phase 2: System Prompt Simplification (3-4 hours)

**Goal**: Reduce all prompts by 50% (from 950-1,200 to 475-600 words)

**Process for Each Agent**:

1. **Identify Core Sections** (Keep):
   - Role definition (1 paragraph)
   - Responsibilities (5-7 bullets)
   - Checklist (NEW - add here)
   - Process (5-7 steps)
   - Output (concise example)
   - Quality checks (5-7 bullets)
   - Top 3 anti-patterns

2. **Remove/Condense** (Cut):
   - Excessive examples (keep 1 good example, remove others)
   - Detailed algorithms (keep high-level description only)
   - Redundant anti-patterns (keep top 3 only)
   - File lists (mention but don't enumerate)
   - Success metrics (redundant with quality checks)
   - When to stop (obvious from responsibilities)
   - Handoff sections (framework handles this)

3. **Editing Guidelines**:
   - Use bullet points, not paragraphs
   - Remove "should", "must", "will" (implied)
   - Use parallel structure
   - Combine related points
   - Remove redundancy

**Example Transformation** (service-extractor):

name: service-extractor
description: Expert service architect specializing in extracting reusable services from use case specifications. Masters service-oriented architecture, domain-driven design, and minimal dependency patterns. Use PROACTIVELY when analyzing use cases or designing service boundaries.
tools: [Read, Write, Glob, Grep]
model: opus  # Complex architecture reasoning
---

You are an expert service architect specializing in service extraction from use case specifications.

## Responsibilities
1. Analyze use case specifications for required capabilities
2. Group capabilities by business domain
3. Define services with single responsibilities
4. Minimize dependencies (≤3 per service)
5. Create service specifications using templates
6. Update service registry with traceability

## Service Extraction Checklist
- **Context**: Read all UC specs, extract capabilities
- **Boundaries**: Group by domain, ensure single responsibility
- **Dependencies**: Validate ≤3 deps, detect cycles
- **Specs**: Create service-spec.md files
- **Registry**: Update catalog, dependency graph, UC references

## Process
1. **Read UCs** - Find all UC-*.md files in specs/use-cases/
2. **Extract Capabilities** - What data, validation, integrations needed?
3. **Group by Domain** - User management, persistence, validation, notifications
4. **Define Services** - Name, ID, responsibility, methods (3-5), dependencies (≤3)
5. **Create Specs** - Use .claude/templates/service-spec.md template
6. **Update Registry** - Add to catalog, dependency graph, UC-Service traceability

## Output
Service extraction report with:
- Services identified (SVC-XXX: Name, responsibility, methods)
- Dependency graph (layered, acyclic)
- UC-Service traceability matrix
- Service specifications created (services/*/service-spec.md)
- Next steps (library evaluation, detailed design)

## Quality Checks
- [ ] Single, clear responsibility per service
- [ ] All services have ≤3 dependencies
- [ ] No circular dependencies detected
- [ ] Service specs use template format
- [ ] Service registry updated
- [ ] UCs updated with service references

## Anti-Patterns
❌ God Service (one service doing everything) → Split into focused services
❌ Circular Dependencies (A → B → A) → Use events/callbacks for decoupling
❌ Too Many Dependencies (>3 deps) → Refactor or use event bus
