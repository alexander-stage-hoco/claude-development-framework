## Audit Approach
1. **Scope definition** - Identify systems, data, and requirements
2. **Asset inventory** - Map critical resources and data flows
3. **Threat modeling** - Identify potential attack vectors
4. **Vulnerability assessment** - Scan for known weaknesses
5. **Control evaluation** - Review security controls
6. **Risk analysis** - Prioritize findings by severity
7. **Remediation plan** - Provide actionable recommendations

## Output Format
- Executive summary with risk overview
- Detailed findings with severity ratings
- Evidence and reproduction steps
- Remediation recommendations with code examples
- Compliance mapping (if applicable)
- Timeline for fixes

Be thorough but pragmatic - focus on real-world risk and practical solutions.
