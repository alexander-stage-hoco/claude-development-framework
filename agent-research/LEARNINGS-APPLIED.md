---

## 1. service-designer ← api-designer (8/10 confidence)

### Comparable Agent Source
- **Repository**: wshobson/agents
- **Agent**: api-designer
- **Confidence**: 8/10 (both do contract-first interface design)

### Learnings Applied

#### 1. Contract-First Design (Mock-Before-Implement)
**Before**: Design Protocol → Implement
**After**: Design Protocol → Mock Implementation → Review → Implement

**Changes**:
- Added "Mock First" step in Process (#6)
- Added "Mock implementation created" to Quality Checks
- Added "Mock implementation (for testing)" to Output

**Why**: Enables immediate testing of interface contracts before real implementation, catching design issues early.

#### 2. Versioning from Day One
**Before**: No version tracking for interfaces
**After**: Version annotation on all Protocol interfaces (v1.0.0)

**Changes**:
- Added "Versioning: Version interfaces from day one (v1.0.0)" to Checklist
- Added "version annotation" to Process steps #2
- Added "Protocol fully typed with version annotation" to Quality Checks
- Added "versioned" to Output description

**Why**: Interface contracts are long-lived. Versioning enables evolution without breaking existing code.

#### 3. Multiple Documentation Layers
**Before**: Single-layer API documentation
**After**: API docs + usage guides + code examples

**Changes**:
- Added "Documentation: API docs, usage guides, examples" to Checklist
- Added "Documentation" step in Process (#7)
- Added "Multi-layer documentation (API + guides + examples)" to Quality Checks
- Added "Multi-layer documentation" to Output

**Why**: Different audiences need different documentation depths (API reference vs. getting-started guides).

#### 4. Performance Considerations in Design
**Before**: Performance considered during implementation
**After**: Performance constraints inform interface design

**Changes**:
- Added "Performance: Consider latency, memory in interface design" to Checklist
- Added "performance needs" to Process #1 (Read Spec)
- Added "performance trade-offs" to Process #8 (Strategies)
- Added "Performance considerations documented" to Quality Checks

**Why**: Interface design decisions (sync/async, batching, streaming) have major performance implications.

#### 5. Design Review Gate
**Before**: Direct progression to TDD after design
**After**: Mandatory design review before implementation

**Changes**:
- Added "Review Gate - Design review before TDD implementation" to Process (#9)
- Added "Design review checklist complete" to Quality Checks
- Added "Design review: Review interface contract before implementation" to Next Steps

**Why**: Interface changes are expensive. Review catches issues before implementation investment.

## 2. service-optimizer ← ml-engineer (8/10 confidence)

### Comparable Agent Source
- **Repository**: wshobson/agents
- **Agent**: ml-engineer
- **Confidence**: 8/10 (both do systematic benchmarking of alternatives)

### Learnings Applied

#### 1. Define Success Metrics FIRST
**Before**: Benchmark → Analyze → Decide
**After**: Define success criteria → Benchmark → Validate → Decide

**Changes**:
- Added "Success Metrics: Define clear success criteria FIRST" to Checklist (#1)
- Added "Define Success - Clear metrics, thresholds BEFORE optimization" to Process (#1)
- Added "Success criteria (metrics, thresholds)" to Output
- Added "Success metrics defined FIRST" to Quality Checks

**Why**: Without clear success criteria, optimization is directionless. Define targets before measuring.

#### 2. Baseline-First Approach
**Before**: Implement 2-3 alternatives → Compare
**After**: Simple baseline → Optimize alternatives → Compare to baseline

**Changes**:
- Added "Baseline: Start with simple implementation" to Checklist
- Added "Baseline First - Implement simplest approach, establish baseline" to Process (#3)
- Added "Baseline results (simple implementation)" to Output
- Added "Baseline (simple) implementation tested" to Quality Checks

**Why**: Establishes reference point. Often baseline is sufficient, avoiding premature optimization.

#### 3. Training/Test Data Split
**Before**: Optimize and test on same data
**After**: Training data for optimization + held-out test data for validation

**Changes**:
- Added "Data Split: Training data + held-out test data" to Checklist
- Added "Split Data - Training data + held-out test data" to Process (#4)
- Added "Run on Training" and "Validate on Test" to Process (#8-9)
- Added "Performance results (training + held-out test data)" to Output
- Added "Training/test data split" to Quality Checks
- Added "All metrics measured (training + test data)" to Quality Checks

**Why**: Prevents overfitting to benchmark data. Validates that optimization generalizes.

#### 4. Experiment Tracking
**Before**: Run benchmarks, record final results
**After**: Log ALL runs for reproducibility and comparison

**Changes**:
- Added "Execution: Run with multiple data sizes, track all experiments" to Checklist
- Added "Track Experiments - Log all runs for reproducibility" to Process (#7)
- Added "Experiment log (all runs, reproducible)" to Output
- Added "All experiments logged for reproducibility" to Quality Checks

**Why**: Enables reproducing results, comparing across iterations, debugging anomalies.

#### 5. Document Assumptions and Limitations
**Before**: Recommend optimal strategy
**After**: Recommend with documented assumptions and limitations

**Changes**:
- Added "Assumptions: Document assumptions and limitations" to Checklist
- Added "Document - Assumptions, limitations, edge cases" to Process (#11)
- Added "Assumptions and limitations" to Output
- Added "Assumptions and limitations documented" to Quality Checks

**Why**: Benchmarks have scope limits. Document what was tested and what wasn't for future reference.

#### 6. Error Handling in Benchmarks
**Before**: Benchmark happy path
**After**: Include error scenarios in benchmarks

**Changes**:
- Added "error handling" to Checklist (Benchmarks)
- Added "error handling" to Process #6 (Benchmark Suite)
- Added "Realistic benchmark data with error handling" to Quality Checks

**Why**: Real-world performance includes error paths. Measure latency under failure conditions.

#### 7. Post-Deployment Monitoring
**Before**: Optimization ends with decision
**After**: Define monitoring strategy for production validation

**Changes**:
- Added "Monitoring: Define post-deployment metrics" to Checklist
- Added "Monitor Plan - Post-deployment monitoring strategy" to Process (#13)
- Added "Post-deployment monitoring plan" to Output
- Added "Post-deployment monitoring plan" to Quality Checks
- Added "Set up monitoring for production deployment" to Next Steps

**Why**: Benchmarks don't perfectly predict production. Monitor to validate optimization in real usage.

## 3. uc-service-tracer ← security-auditor (8/10 confidence)

### Comparable Agent Source
- **Repository**: wshobson/agents
- **Agent**: security-auditor
- **Confidence**: 8/10 (both validate compliance against specifications)

### Learnings Applied

#### 1. Scope Definition with Clear Objectives
**Before**: Start validation immediately
**After**: Define scope, objectives, standards, success criteria FIRST

**Changes**:
- Added "Scope: Define validation objectives, standards, success criteria" to Checklist (#1)
- Added "Define Scope - Validation objectives, standards (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148), success criteria" to Process (#1)
- Added "Scope and objectives" to Output (Executive Summary)
- Added "Scope and objectives defined" to Quality Checks
- Added "Standards referenced (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148)" to Quality Checks

**Why**: Clear scope prevents scope creep and ensures stakeholders agree on what compliance means.

#### 2. Evidence-Based Findings (file:line)
**Before**: Report violations generically
**After**: Every violation has file:line evidence

**Changes**:
- Added "Evidence: File:line for every violation" to Checklist

- Added "Evidence-based violations (file:line for each)" to Output
- Added "Evidence collected (file:line for ALL violations)" to Quality Checks
- Added "All violations MUST have file:line evidence - MANDATORY" to Validation Rules

**Why**: Enables developers to immediately locate and fix violations. No ambiguity.

#### 3. Risk Prioritization (Severity Levels)
**Before**: All violations treated equally
**After**: Assign severity levels (critical/high/medium/low)

**Changes**:
- Added "Risk Levels: Assign severity (critical, high, medium, low)" to Checklist
- Added "Risk Assessment - Assign severity levels (critical/high/medium/low)" to Process (#7)
- Added severity annotations to Output violations:
  - Missing refs (severity: critical)
  - Mismatches (severity: high)
  - Orphans (severity: medium)
- Added "Risk levels assigned (critical/high/medium/low)" to Quality Checks
- Added severity levels to Validation Rules (#1-4)
- Added "Findings MUST be risk-prioritized - MANDATORY" to Validation Rules
- Updated Next Steps to prioritize by severity

**Why**: Not all violations are equal. Critical issues block implementation, low issues can be deferred.

#### 4. Compliance Mapping (Expected vs. Actual)
**Before**: Report violations as list
**After**: Table showing expected state vs. actual state for each requirement

**Changes**:
- Added "Compliance Map: Expected vs. actual traceability state" to Checklist
- Added "Compliance Map - Expected vs. actual state table" to Process (#8)
- Added "Compliance mapping (expected vs. actual state)" to Output
- Added "Compliance mapping complete (expected vs. actual)" to Quality Checks

**Why**: Clear visualization of gaps. Shows what's required vs. what exists.

#### 5. Executive Summary + Technical Details
**Before**: Single-level report
**After**: Executive summary for stakeholders + detailed findings for developers

**Changes**:
- Restructured Output into 4 sections:
  1. **Executive Summary** (scope, compliance score, critical findings, risk summary)
  2. **Technical Details** (compliance map, matrices, evidence-based violations)
  3. **Remediation** (specific steps, prioritized actions)
  4. **Standards & Metrics** (standards referenced, health metrics)
- Added "Executive Summary - High-level overview for stakeholders" to Process (#10)
- Added "Executive summary created" to Quality Checks

**Why**: Different audiences need different depths. Executives want overview, developers need specifics.

#### 6. Specific Remediation Steps
**Before**: Generic recommendations
**After**: Specific remediation steps with code examples

**Changes**:
- Added "Specific steps with code examples" to Output (Remediation section)
- Added "Prioritized action items (by severity)" to Output
- Added "Specific remediation steps with examples" to Quality Checks

**Why**: Generic advice ("fix traceability") is not actionable. Show exactly what to change.

#### 7. Follow Recognized Standards
**Before**: Ad-hoc validation rules
**After**: Reference ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 traceability standards

**Changes**:
- Added "standards (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148)" to Process #1
- Updated Validation Rules title to "Validation Rules (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148)"
- Added "Standards referenced (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148)" to Output
- Added "Standards referenced (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148)" to Quality Checks

**Why**: Industry standards provide credibility and established best practices.

#### 8. Re-Testing After Fixes
**Before**: Validation is one-time
**After**: Define re-validation workflow for testing fixes

**Changes**:
- Added "Re-test: Workflow for validating fixes" to Checklist
- Added "Re-validation Plan - Workflow for testing fixes" to Process (#12)
- Added "Re-validation workflow" to Output (Remediation section)
- Added "Re-validation workflow documented" to Quality Checks
- Added "Re-validation: Use same scope/criteria after fixes" to Next Steps

**Why**: Fixes need validation. Document how to re-run validation consistently.

#### 9. Bidirectional Validation Enhancement
**Before**: Already had bidirectional traceability (A→B)
**After**: Explicitly documented as (A→B AND B→A) for clarity

**Changes**:
- Updated Process #4 to "Check Bidirectional - Service 'Used By' matches UC refs (A→B AND B→A)"
- Updated Validation Rules #3 to "Bidirectional traceability MUST agree (A→B AND B→A) - HIGH"
- Updated Quality Checks to "Bidirectional traceability verified (A→B AND B→A)"

**Why**: Makes bidirectional checking explicit. No ambiguity about what "bidirectional" means.

## Learnings Extraction Methodology

### Source Analysis
1. **Read comparable agent source** (YAML + prompt)
2. **Extract patterns** (what they do, how they structure work)
3. **Critical evaluation** (what applies, what doesn't)
4. **Confidence rating** (1-10 scale based on domain similarity)

### Application Principles
1. **Extract methodology, not content** (e.g., "use evidence-based findings" not "scan for CVEs")
2. **Preserve our unique style** (service-oriented, UC-centric, Protocol-based)
3. **Enhance, don't replace** (add to existing workflows, don't rewrite)
4. **Document trade-offs** (why we applied X but not Y)

### Quality Gates
1. ✅ Learnings are domain-appropriate (not forced analogies)
2. ✅ Enhancements preserve existing functionality
3. ✅ Changes are actionable (specific steps, not vague improvements)
4. ✅ Documentation updated consistently
