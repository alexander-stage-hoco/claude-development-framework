# Example: Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Scenario**: Complete service layer development using multiple subagents in sequence
**Complexity**: High
**Duration**: ~90 minutes
**Framework Features**: Multi-agent workflow, sequential execution, checkpoints
**Subagents Used**: service-extractor ‚Üí service-library-finder ‚Üí service-designer ‚Üí service-dependency-analyzer ‚Üí uc-service-tracer

---

## Context

**Project**: Inventory Management System
**Session**: 3 (after use case specifications complete)
**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ 8 use cases specified
- ‚ùå No services extracted yet
- ‚ùå No architecture designed

**User Goal**: Complete entire service layer development in one session using subagents

## Session Transcript

### User Request

```
User: "We have 8 use cases complete. Please extract services, evaluate libraries,
design interfaces, validate dependencies, and check traceability. Use subagents
to automate this entire workflow."
```

---

### Claude's Response

```
Claude: I'll orchestrate multiple subagents to complete the service layer development.

**Workflow Plan**:
1. **service-extractor**: Extract services from 8 UCs (10 min)
2. **service-library-finder**: Evaluate libraries for key services (15 min)
3. **service-designer**: Design detailed interfaces (20 min)
4. **service-dependency-analyzer**: Validate architecture (5 min)
5. **uc-service-tracer**: Verify traceability (5 min)

**Total Estimated Time**: ~55 minutes

**Checkpoints**:
- After each subagent, I'll present results for your approval
- You can stop at any checkpoint if changes needed

Proceeding with Phase 1: Service Extraction...
```

## Phase 1: Service Extraction (service-extractor)

```
Claude: Launching service-extractor subagent...

[10 minutes later]

‚úÖ **Service Extraction Complete**

**12 services extracted** from 8 use cases:
- InventoryService, ProductService, SupplierService
- OrderService, PurchaseOrderService, ReceivingService
- AuthService, UserService, NotificationService
- ValidationService, AuditLogService, ReportingService

**Architecture**:
- 5 layers (Layer 1-5)
- No circular dependencies
- All services ‚â§3 dependencies

**Proceed to Phase 2 (Library Evaluation)?**
```

### User: "Yes, continue."

---

## Phase 2: Library Evaluation (service-library-finder)

```
Claude: Launching service-library-finder for 3 key services...

[15 minutes later]

‚úÖ **Library Evaluation Complete**

**Recommendations**:
1. **AuthService**: PyJWT + Passlib (91% score)
2. **NotificationService**: Twilio SDK (88% score)
3. **ReportingService**: Build custom (no suitable libraries)

**Cost Savings**: $3,500/year (avoided custom auth development)

**Proceed to Phase 3 (Interface Design)?**
```

### User: "Yes."

---

## Phase 3: Interface Design (service-designer)

```
Claude: Launching service-designer for all 12 services...

[20 minutes later]

‚úÖ **Interface Design Complete**

**Deliverables**:
- 12 Protocol interfaces with full type hints
- 45 data models (frozen dataclasses)
- 28 error types
- Implementation strategies documented

**All services ready for TDD implementation**

**Proceed to Phase 4 (Dependency Validation)?**
```

### User: "Yes."

---

## Phase 4: Dependency Validation (service-dependency-analyzer)

```
Claude: Launching service-dependency-analyzer...

[5 minutes later]

‚úÖ **Dependency Analysis Complete**

**Architecture Quality**: Excellent

- No circular dependencies
- All services ‚â§2 dependencies (max allowed: 3)
- Clean 5-layer architecture
- Average 1.3 dependencies per service

**Proceed to Phase 5 (Traceability Validation)?**
```

### User: "Yes."

---

## Phase 5: Traceability Validation (uc-service-tracer)

```
Claude: Launching uc-service-tracer...

[5 minutes later]

‚úÖ **Traceability Validation Complete**

**Status**: 100% Complete

- All 8 UCs reference services
- All 12 services used by at least one UC
- Bidirectional traceability verified
- No orphan services

---

**Multi-Agent Workflow Complete! üéâ**
```

---

## Final Summary

```
Claude: ‚úÖ **Complete Service Layer Development Finished!**

**What Was Accomplished**:
1. ‚úÖ 12 services extracted and specified
2. ‚úÖ 3 external libraries evaluated and recommended
3. ‚úÖ 12 Protocol interfaces designed with type hints
4. ‚úÖ Architecture validated (no cycles, clean layers)
5. ‚úÖ 100% UC-Service traceability achieved

**Time Breakdown**:
- Service extraction: 10 min
- Library evaluation: 15 min
- Interface design: 20 min
- Dependency analysis: 5 min
- Traceability validation: 5 min
- **Total**: 55 minutes

**Manual Effort Equivalent**: 2-3 days (16-24 hours)
**Time Saved**: ~15-23 hours
**Quality**: Higher (automated validation catches human errors)

**Files Created**: 38 files
- 12 service specifications (~4,800 lines)
- 3 library evaluations (~1,200 lines)
- 1 dependency analysis report
- 1 traceability report
- 8 UC updates (service references)
- Service registry (updated)

**Next Steps**:
1. Begin TDD implementation (Layer 1 services first)
2. Implement libraries (PyJWT, Passlib, Twilio SDK)
3. Create integration tests

**Architecture Status**: Production-ready ‚úÖ

Ready to begin implementation!
```

## Key Takeaways

**Framework Enforcement**: Multi-agent workflow maintains quality at each checkpoint
**Subagent Value**: 55 minutes vs. 2-3 days manual work (97% time savings)
**Quality Maintained**: Automated validation at each step prevents errors
**User Control**: Checkpoints allow intervention if needed
