# Claude Development Framework - Template

**Version**: 2.2 (Agent Ecosystem + Comprehensive Test Suite)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-03
**Based On**: Learnings from Knowledge Graph Builder project

---

## What This Is

A disciplined, spec-driven, incremental development framework designed for AI-assisted software development with Claude.

This template provides a complete methodology for building high-quality software with Claude as a **disciplined development partner** that enforces quality standards, not just generates code.

---

## Philosophy

> **"Slow is smooth, smooth is fast."**
>
> Incremental, disciplined development produces better results than rushing.

**Core Principles**:
1. Specification-First (no code without specs)
2. Test-Driven Development (tests before implementation)
3. Incremental Progress (1-3 hour iterations)
4. Never Compromise Tests (fix system, not tests)
5. Document Technical Decisions (ADRs are binding)

---

## Structure

### Main Framework Document
- **docs/claude-development-framework.md** (615 lines) - Core framework "constitution"
  - Quick Start (15 minutes)
  - Core Principles
  - Project Structure
  - Context Window Management
  - Development Workflow
  - Enforcement Mechanisms

### User Documentation (`docs/`)

Comprehensive guides for human developers:

| Guide | Size | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **troubleshooting.md** | 544 lines | Common problems & recovery procedures |
| **walkthrough-todo-api.md** | 774 lines | Complete 5-session example project |
| **example-first-session.md** | 261 lines | Example transcript of perfect first session |
| **session-types.md** | 350 lines | Reference guide for different session patterns |
| **advanced/tool-integration.md** | 594 lines | Git hooks, CI/CD, IDE setup |
| **advanced/large-codebase-context.md** | 475 lines | Advanced strategies for 50K+ LOC |

### Claude Context Files (`.claude/`)

What Claude reads at session start:
- **templates/** - 23 ready-to-use template files (CLAUDE.md, development-rules.md, etc.)
- **guides/** - 1 essential guide (research-organization.md)
- **quick-ref/** - 3 single-page reference cards (session-start.md, tdd-cycle.md, git.md)

### Setup Tools

- **init-project.sh** - Automated project initialization script
- **.gitignore** - Python project gitignore template

---

## Context Window Efficiency

The framework uses **incremental context loading** for maximum efficiency:

| Strategy | Overhead | Available Context | Use Case |
|----------|----------|------------------|----------|
| **TIER 1 only** | 3.3% (6.7K) | 96.7% (193K) | ‚úÖ Recommended for most sessions |
| **TIER 1+2** | 8.2% (16.5K) | 91.8% (184K) | Active development |
| **TIER 1+2+3** | 15.1% (30.3K) | 84.9% (170K) | Quality gates active |
| **All tiered (1-4)** | 29.5% (59K) | 70.5% (141K) | Template creation |
| **All 59 files** | 69.4% (139K) | 30.6% (61K) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Learning only |

**Key Insight**: Load TIER 1 (4 files, 3.3%) at session start, then load additional files on-demand. The `docs/` directory (29 files, ~40% overhead) is for reference browsing, not context loading.

**Estimate usage anytime**: `./scripts/estimate-context.sh`

---

## Quick Start

‚ö° **Want to start FAST?** See [`docs/10-minute-start.md`](./docs/10-minute-start.md) - Get to your first Claude session in 10 minutes!

üìò **Want more details?** See [`quick-start-guide.md`](./quick-start-guide.md) for a complete walkthrough.

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

Use the initialization script to set up a new project in 30 seconds:

```bash
# From this template directory
./init-project.sh my-new-project

# Then start working
cd my-new-project
```

The script creates the complete directory structure, copies all framework files, and sets up initial placeholder files.

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Read the Framework** (20 minutes)
   Start here: [`docs/claude-development-framework.md`](./docs/claude-development-framework.md)

2. **Understand the Approach**
   - Specifications come FIRST (before any code)
   - Tests define correctness (written before implementation)
   - Work in small iterations (max 3 hours each)
   - Document all technical decisions (ADRs)

3. **See It In Action**
   Read the complete example: [`docs/walkthrough-todo-api.md`](./docs/walkthrough-todo-api.md)

   Shows 5 sessions building a TODO API from scratch using the framework.

---

## Using This Template

### Option 1: Copy to New Project

```bash
# Copy entire framework to your project
cp -r /path/to/2025-09-Claude-Development-Approach/.claude your-project/
cp -r /path/to/2025-09-Claude-Development-Approach/docs your-project/

# Create project-specific .claude/CLAUDE.md from template
cp your-project/.claude/templates/CLAUDE.md your-project/.claude/CLAUDE.md
# Then customize with project name and date
```

### Option 2: Use as Reference

Keep this template separate and reference it when:
- Starting new projects
- Training team members
- Resolving methodology questions
- Updating development practices
- Need troubleshooting help

### Option 3: Customize for Your Domain

See "How to Adapt This Framework" in main document for:
- Data Science projects
- API-First projects
- Embedded Systems
- Other domains

### Using Agents

**Quick Start:**
Agents work through trigger keywords or proactive invocation:
- "generate tests for UC-001" ‚Üí test-writer
- "create branch for iteration 2" ‚Üí git-workflow-helper
- "check tech debt" ‚Üí tech-debt-detector

**Complete Reference:** See [.claude/AGENTS.md](./.claude/AGENTS.md) for full agent library

## Project History

This framework was developed based on learnings from the **Knowledge Graph Builder** project (September 2025), which successfully implemented:
- 6 use cases (UC01-UC05, UC08, UC15)
- 93 test files with 1,176 test functions
- 100% test coverage on core logic
- Complete spec-to-implementation traceability
- Neo4j knowledge graph with entity extraction pipeline

The framework crystallizes the lessons learned from that project into a reusable template.

## Quick Reference

**The 10 Non-Negotiable Rules**:
1. Specifications Are Law
2. Tests Define Correctness
3. Incremental Above All
4. Research Informs Implementation
5. Two-Level Planning
6. No Shortcuts
7. Technical Decisions Are Binding
8. BDD for User-Facing Features
9. Code Quality Standards
10. Session Discipline

**Every Session Must**:
- ‚òë Claude reads `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- ‚òë Reviews `planning/current-iteration.md`
- ‚òë Writes tests BEFORE code
- ‚òë All tests green before proceeding
- ‚òë Updates status documents

**When Claude Deviates**:
- Say: "Check development rules"
- Say: "Tests first, then implementation"
- Say: "What does the specification say?"
