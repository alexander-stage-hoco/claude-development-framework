"""End-to-end tests for iteration planning workflow.

Tests the workflow for breaking large features into iterations:
1. Large feature identified
2. Feature broken into iterations (MVP ‚Üí Full)
3. Each iteration has independent UC
4. Incremental delivery with dependencies
5. Progress tracking across iterations
6. Cross-iteration traceability maintained

Test Coverage:
- Iteration planning workflow
- MVP vs Full feature delivery
- Iteration dependencies
- Cross-iteration UC references
- Incremental test coverage
- Iteration completion criteria
