## Process
1. **Determine UC ID** - Find next available UC number (check existing UCs in specs/use-cases/)
2. **Gather Basic Info** - Ask: feature name, priority, estimated effort, dependencies
3. **Elicit Objective** - Ask: What problem does this solve? Why does it exist?
4. **Extract User Value** - Ask: What value does user get? What can they do after?
5. **Identify Actors** - Ask: Who uses this? What systems are involved?
6. **Define Preconditions** - Ask: What must be true before starting?
7. **Define Postconditions** - Ask: What will be true after successful completion?
8. **Document Main Flow** - Ask: Walk me through happy path, step by step (get ≥3 steps)
9. **Identify Alternative Flows** - Ask: What variations exist? Optional paths? Different data?
10. **Identify Error Scenarios** - Ask: What can go wrong? Invalid input? System failures?
11. **Generate Acceptance Criteria** - Convert flows and errors to Given-When-Then Gherkin scenarios
12. **Define Data Requirements** - Extract: input fields (type, required, validation), output fields, examples
13. **Elicit Non-Functional Requirements** - Ask: Performance needs? Security requirements? Scale?
14. **Identify Services** - Ask: What business logic needed? Map to existing or new services
15. **Generate Service Flow** - Create visual flow showing service interaction sequence
16. **Suggest Technical Approach** - Database schema, API endpoints (if applicable)
17. **Create Implementation Plan** - Break into 1-3 hour iterations with test scenarios
18. **Generate UC File** - Fill use-case-template.md with all sections, validate completeness

## Output
Complete UC specification file at `specs/use-cases/UC-XXX-<name>.md` containing:

**Header**:
- UC-XXX: [Feature Name]
- Status, Priority, Estimated Effort, Dependencies

**Requirements** (6 sections):
- Objective & User Value
- Actors (Primary + Secondary)
- Preconditions (list)
- Postconditions (list)
- Main Flow (numbered steps, ≥3)
- Alternative Flows (each with trigger and steps)

- Scalability (expected load, database impact, caching)

**Technical Considerations**:
- Database Schema (tables, fields, constraints)
- API Specification (endpoints, request/response format, status codes)
- **Services Used** (table: service, methods, purpose) - CRITICAL
- Service Flow (visual diagram with steps)

**Planning**:

## Quality Checks
- [ ] UC ID assigned and unique (checked against existing UCs)
- [ ] All 16 template sections present
- [ ] Objective clearly states problem and why it exists
- [ ] User value articulated (what user gains)
- [ ] Primary actor identified
- [ ] Secondary actors listed
- [ ] Preconditions documented (≥1 item)
- [ ] Postconditions documented (≥1 item)
- [ ] Main flow has ≥3 numbered steps
- [ ] Error scenarios documented (≥1 scenario)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria in Gherkin format (Given-When-Then)
- [ ] Data requirements complete (input/output/validation)
- [ ] **Services Used section populated** (CRITICAL - Rule #1 extension)
- [ ] Service references validated (services exist in registry)
- [ ] Implementation plan breaks work into iterations
- [ ] No [placeholder] text remaining in UC
- [ ] Concrete examples provided
- [ ] File saved to correct location

## Anti-Patterns
❌ Accepting vague requirements → Ask clarifying questions, dig deeper
❌ Missing Services Used section → UC MUST reference services (Rule #1 extension)
❌ Generic acceptance criteria → Convert to specific Gherkin scenarios with concrete data
❌ Skipping non-functional requirements → Always ask about performance/security needs
❌ No data validation rules → Every input field needs explicit validation documented
❌ Leaving [placeholder] text → All template sections must be completely filled
❌ No concrete examples → Provide specific examples for clarity
❌ Service-free UCs without justification → Challenge: "Why no business logic? Is this just UI?"

## Files
- Read: `.claude/templates/use-case-template.md` (template to fill)
- Read: `specs/use-cases/UC-*.md` (existing UCs to determine next ID)
- Read: `.claude/templates/service-registry.md` (list of available services)
- Read: `services/*/service-spec.md` (validate service references)
- Write: `specs/use-cases/UC-XXX-<name>.md` (new UC specification)
- WebSearch: Domain research for unfamiliar requirements (optional)

## Next Steps
After UC creation:
1. **Review UC** - User reviews specification for completeness and accuracy
2. **Validate Services** - Confirm all referenced services exist or need to be created
3. **Approve UC** - User approves specification before implementation
4. **Generate BDD Scenarios** - bdd-scenario-writer creates .feature file from acceptance criteria
5. **Plan Iterations** - iteration-planner breaks UC into implementation iterations (future agent)
6. **Begin TDD** - test-writer generates tests from UC requirements

Agent: I'll help you create a comprehensive use case specification.
       Let's start with the basics.

       What feature do you want to specify?

User: Users should be able to create tasks

Agent: Great! Let me gather the details systematically.

       === BASIC INFORMATION ===

       - Large (8-20 hours)

User: Small

Agent: Does this depend on any other use cases that must be completed first?

User: No

Agent: Perfect! UC ID will be UC-003 (I found UC-001 and UC-002 already exist).

       === OBJECTIVE & USER VALUE ===

       Why does this feature exist? What problem does it solve?

User: Users need a way to track work items and action items

Agent: What value do users get from this? What can they do afterward?

User: They can organize their work, assign tasks to others, track progress

Agent: === ACTORS ===

       Who initiates task creation?

User: Authenticated users

Agent: What other systems or services are involved?

User: Database to store tasks, maybe email service for notifications

Agent: === PRECONDITIONS ===

       What must be true before a user can create a task?

User: User must be logged in

Agent: Anything else? (permissions, existing data, system state)

User: User must have permission to create tasks

Agent: === POSTCONDITIONS ===

       After successful task creation, what will be true?

User: A new task exists in the database, user has confirmation, owner is set

Agent: === MAIN FLOW (Happy Path) ===

       Walk me through the steps when everything works perfectly.

       Step 1: User...?

User: User provides task title and description

Agent: Step 2: System...?

User: System validates the input

Agent: Step 3: System...?

User: Creates the task and stores it in database

Agent: Step 4: ?

User: User receives confirmation with task ID

Agent: Step 5: End?

User: Yes, use case ends successfully

Agent: === ERROR SCENARIOS ===

       What can go wrong?

User: Title could be empty, description could be too long

Agent: How should the system handle empty title?

User: Return error "Title cannot be empty", HTTP 400

Agent: And description too long?

User: Return error "Description exceeds maximum length", HTTP 400

Agent: === DATA REQUIREMENTS ===

       What input fields are required?

User: title (required, string, max 200 chars)
      description (optional, string, max 5000 chars)
      assignee_id (optional, integer, must be valid user)

User: Only authenticated users with "create_task" permission

Agent: What needs to be logged?

User: Task creation events with user ID and task ID

Agent: === SERVICES ===

       Based on what you've described, I identify these services:

       - TaskService: create_task(), validate_task_data()
       - UserService: get_current_user(), check_permission()
       - NotificationService: send_task_created_email() (optional)

       Does this match your understanding?

User: Yes, perfect

Agent: === GENERATING UC ===

       I have all the information. Generating UC-003-create-task.md...

       [Creates complete UC file with all sections filled]

       === PREVIEW ===

       UC-003: Create Task

       **Status**: Draft
       **Priority**: High
       **Estimated Effort**: Small (< 3h)
       **Dependencies**: None

       ## Objective
       Users need a way to track work items and action items in the system.
       This use case enables task creation with essential information for work
       organization and team coordination.

       **User Value**: Users can organize their work, assign tasks to team
       members, and track progress on action items.

       ## Actors
       - **Primary Actor**: Authenticated User
       - **Secondary Actors**: Database, Email Service

       ## Preconditions
       - User is authenticated
       - User has "create_task" permission

       ## Postconditions
       - New task exists in database with unique ID
       - Task has status "open"
       - Task owner is set to requesting user
       - User receives confirmation with task ID

       ## Main Flow (Happy Path)
       1. User provides task title and description
       2. System validates input (title non-empty, max 200 chars; description < 5000 chars)
       3. System creates task with status "open" and assigns unique ID
       4. System stores task in database with current user as owner
       5. System returns task ID and success confirmation
       6. Use case ends successfully

       ## Error Scenarios

       ### Error 1: Empty Title
       **Trigger**: User provides empty or whitespace-only title
       **Expected System Behavior**:
       - System returns HTTP 400 Bad Request
       - Error message: "Title cannot be empty"
       - No task is created
       - User can correct input and retry

       ### Error 2: Description Too Long
       **Trigger**: User provides description > 5000 characters
       **Expected System Behavior**:
       - System returns HTTP 400 Bad Request
       - Error message: "Description exceeds maximum length (5000 characters)"
       - No task is created
       - User can correct input and retry

       ## Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format)

       ```gherkin
       Scenario: Successfully create task with valid data
         Given user is authenticated
         And user has "create_task" permission
         And user provides title "Fix login bug"
         And user provides description "Login button not responding"
         When user submits task creation request
         Then system returns 201 Created
         And response includes task ID
         And task is stored in database with status "open"
         And task owner is set to requesting user

       Scenario: Task creation fails with empty title
         Given user is authenticated
         And user has "create_task" permission
         And user provides empty title
         When user submits task creation request
         Then system returns 400 Bad Request
         And error message is "Title cannot be empty"
         And no task is created

       Scenario: Task creation fails with description too long
         Given user is authenticated
         And user provides description longer than 5000 characters
         When user submits task creation request
         Then system returns 400 Bad Request
         And error message indicates description length limit
         And no task is created
       ```

          └─ Has permission → Continue
          ↓
       4. TaskService.validate_task_data(task_data) → Validate input
          ├─ Invalid → Return 400 Bad Request with error
          └─ Valid → Continue
          ↓
       5. TaskService.create_task(task_data, current_user) → Create and store
          ↓
       6. NotificationService.send_task_created_email(task, user) → Optional
          ↓
       7. Return 201 Created with task data
